Tetris is a popular tile matching puzzle game that mesmerized gamers all over the world in the 1980s. Using python and its pygame module, we have attempted to create a simple playable version of tetris using various datastructures.

Controls(keyboard):

Up - rotate shape anticlockwise
Down - move shape down a little faster
Left - move shape one step left
Right -move shape one step right
P- Pause
